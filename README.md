README

    Songpack is a package built and designed for use in Assignment 7 of the University of Southern
    Maine's COS285 Data Structures course, taught by Dr. Behrooz Mansouri.

    This program is intended to operate using a provided file named 'song_lyrics.tsv'

Configuration

    In order to use this program, one must have a Java compiler and Runtime environment installed.

Operation

    In order to use the program as intended, one must first compile the java files within the
    package. Following compilation, one may run the program by executing 'program7.java' in the 'songpack'
    package and passing the file path of 'song_lyrics.tsv' to the console, as input. The given program will only work when
    passing another input value into the console, which should be the name of a music genre. For example: 'rock'

    These are the only two lines that should be necessary to use the associated program...

    'javac ~/songpack/*.java'
    'java ~/songpack/program5 ~/song_lyrics.tsv rock'

    Upon execution, this program will output the following:
    The number of each executed rotation in an AVL balancing algorithm
    Height of the built AVL tree
    The build time for the AVL tree with Songs of the given genre
    The search times for five arbitrarily chosen searches in the AVL tree
    The build time for the BST with Songs of the given genre
    The height of the built BST
    The search times for five arbitrarily chosen searches in the BST tree
